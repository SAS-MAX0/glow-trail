# Glow trail extension

A chrome extension I made that helps add custom animations to mouse movements, giving that mouse a bit of flair and design.

## Features
- Control the number of circles in the trail.
- Choose from presets color themes or make your own custom color.
- Pick the trail type you want like, Circle, dotted or spiral.
- Works on all pages just make sure you refresh.

## Installation
- Download the project file and unzip it.
- then head to chrome and go to ==chrome://extensions/==
- then enable developer mode.
- then load unpacked and select the folder.
- that is it, you just installed it. Now test it. Happy testing. Make sure to check the settings you can tweak the trail to meet your choice.
